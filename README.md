# Forest Image Segmentation

---

### [**Description**](#) <a name="descr"></a>
Automatic categorization and segmentation of forest cover is of great importance for sustainable development and urban planning. The importance of forests cannot be underestimated as they support the flow of essential ecosystem services such as fibre, energy, recreation, biodiversity, carbon storage and flux and water. Forests are also important areas to identify before commencing any kind of industrial activity that requires on field work. Satellite or remote sensed images can be used to identify and segment the forest cover regions in the image and get a clear idea about how much land does forest cover. This problem is defined as a binary segmentation task to detect forest areas.

### [***Data Preparation***](#) <a name="prepare"></a>
This dataset was obtained from Land Cover Classification Track in DeepGlobe Challenge . For more details on the dataset refer the related publication - DeepGlobe 2018: A Challenge to Parse the Earth through Satellite Images. The images in the dataset were patched into images of size 256x256 to create more number of image samples.
